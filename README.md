# PHYSIS

**Pediatric Height Yielded through Skeletal Interpretation System**

Pediatric endocrine clinical decision support — bone age scoring, adult height prediction, growth charting, and additional calculators for inpatient and outpatient practice. PHYSIS is a **standalone application built from scratch** for pediatric endocrinology workflows. 

**Inspiration**

PHYSIS draws on published methods and clinical references with its main focus of making important clinical tools available and easily accessible. While entirely developed by myself, PHYSIS takes inspiration from [Bone Age](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.eatyourpeas.tannerwhitehouse) and [endocrinologist](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/endocrinologist), both developed by [eatyourpeas](https://github.com/eatyourpeas). Inspiration for additional clinical tools from [Child Metrics](https://www.ceddcozum.com/), developed and maintained by the Turkish Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (TSPED).

**Disclaimer**

Please be sure to read the [Disclaimer](https://calc.dom.doctor/disclaimer) and [Terms of Use](ToU.md) before using PHYSIS.

**P.H.Y.S.I.S. Production:** [https://calc.dom.doctor](https://calc.dom.doctor)

**Current release:** **v0.8.2** (28 Aug 2026) — Disclaimer and Terms of Use pages sync from repo markdown.

## Primary workflow: growth & height prediction

The main workflow (`/growth`) guides TW3-RUS bone age scoring through adult height prediction and CDC growth chart visualization.


| Step                 | Feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **TW3 bone age**     | Hand-navigator scoring for all 13 RUS landmarks with per-stage drawings and criteria text (individual atlas PNGs + markdown descriptions), discrete stage slider, and SMS → bone age lookup (sex-specific Tables A1/A3, A5/A6) |
| **Parental stature** | Father/mother heights (cm, in, or ft+in) or direct MPH entry; distinguishes **MPH** (Tanner, TW3) from **MPS** (parental average, adjusted RWT & Khamis-Roche)                                                                 |
| **APH methods**      | Bone-age mode: **TW3**, **adjusted RWT**, **original RWT**. No-bone-age mode: **Khamis-Roche** only. Missing-input checklists on result cards before calculation.                                                              |
| **CDC growth chart** | Plots stature and weight vs chronological age and bone-age–shifted age; overlays MPH/MPS and selected predicted adult height                                                                                                   |
| **Show work / QC**   | Audit trail of inputs, coefficient lookup, landmark scoring, and discrepancy flags (`ShowWorkSection`)                                                                                                                         |
| **Clinical copy**    | Configurable charting summary with method references and TW3 atlas citations                                                                                                                                                   |

### Platform & data

- [x] CDC plotting logic fixes
- [x] Top-banner attribution updated — PHYSIS is an independent app, not a fork of eatyourpeas/endocrinologist
- [x] Deployed to `calc.dom.doctor` via Cloudflare Workers
- [x] Scheduled midnight UTC GitHub sync — Worker compares `master` SHA and dispatches deploy when changed

- [x] Release planning checklist moved from `predeployPHYSIS.txt` to `predeployPHYSIS.md`
- [x] Sequential release tagging script (`npm run release:tag`) using `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (`0.y.x` during beta; current **v0.8.5**)
- [x] Per-branch pending release deltas (`.release/pending/<branch-slug>.json`; `npm run release:pending:init|show|apply|sync-siblings`) — feature branches record one bump; master apply uses current latest tag; sibling sync brings `origin/master` into other open pending branches only (never merges them onto master; conflicts abort for discussion at that branch’s merge)
- [x] Header version + last-updated date above feedback icons (`src/data/appVersion.ts`; version **v0.8.5**; last-updated injected at build from HEAD commit date so every master push refreshes it)
- [x] Home header RedCAP survey links — logo + pre/post emoji links centered between title and GitHub feedback
- [x] Mobile home header — compact RedCAP + GitHub feedback column to avoid icon overlap
- [x] Improved PHYSIS favicon (`public/favicon-physis.png`) with cache-busting route favicon hook
- [x] Public community repo (`doctor-dom/physis-calcs`) — header Issues/Discussions/Planned Updates links; parallel Actions workflow syncs a community-safe README
- [x] Persistent footer Terms of Use link (`/terms-of-use`) sharing the disclaimer banner, with UTC last-updated timestamp
- [x] `/disclaimer` and `/terms-of-use` render from repo-root `Disclaimer.md` and [`ToU.md`](ToU.md) at Vite build/dev (synced on each master deploy)
- [x] `ToU.md` `Last updated:` stamp synced from the file’s last content-edit time (`npm run legal:stamp` on commit / master push)
- [x] CALCS collections reorganized — Electrolytes/Fluids, Insulin/Glucose, Adrenal, Gonad Auxology, Outpatient Endocrinology, Bone Health, Lab Assays; coming-soon placeholders; renal-electrolytes under Bone Health; PEARLS documented but hub hidden until promoted; legacy `/calculators/normograms` redirects to gonad-auxology
- [x] CALCS calculator chrome — back link to the active collection roster and Reset fields (remount) under the brand/GitHub header
- [x] EMR import + Esoterix RefRange tools — Epic or Cerner paste; age/sex/SMR/draw-time Esoterix USA range selection with high/low flags and expandable full charts (`/lab-interpretation`)
- [x] Lab Search/ Conversion + Esoterix Reference Ranges — search by name/alias/code; seven category chips (Adrenal, HPG, Thyroid, Growth, Adrenal Medulla, Bone Health, Diabetes/Glycemia); expandable expected-value cards; SI ↔ mass conversion; Labcorp PDF link (`/esoterix-labs`)

## Clinical notes

- **TRP** < 0.85 → excess phosphorus wasting / hyperparathyroidism
- **CCR** ≤ 0.02 → consider CaSR testing; < 0.01 → familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) likely
- **Spot UCa/UCr** > 0.2 → higher predisposition to nephrocalcinosis; compare to age-specific 95th percentiles
- **TTKG** < 7 (when valid) → mineralocorticoid deficiency suggested in hyperkalemia
- **FWD** uses TBW fraction × weight × (NaSerum/NaTarget − 1)
- **Hyperglycemia corrected sodium** — cNa = sNa + 0.024 × (sGlu − 100)
- **Hyponatremia correction** — target serum sodium rise ≤ 0.5–1 mEq/L per hour and < 10–12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours
